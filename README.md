# Exploring ggplot2

Here is a rapid exploration of data visualization using ggplot2.

The aim here is to present the best visualization to answer a specific question and to do so with a pretty plot.

Obviously, pretty plots are not the end goal but "lickable" plots are an essential component of any good data presentation. 

The aim here is to rapidly run through Hadley Wickham's ggplot2 book, with a focus on learning the logic behind this awesome package.

The scripts are arranged as follows (following the organization of the book):

- [Overview of data visualization](DataVisOverview.md)
- [The grammar of ggplot2](TheGrammar.md)
- [A layered approach to plotting](PeelTheOnion.md)
- [Quick overview of layer options](PlotTools.md)
- [Scales and Legends](ScalesandLegends.md)
- [Faceting](Facets.md)
- [Plotting graphs](PlottingGraphs.md)
